@AlexGKim Also, be sure not to accidentally run the revision --autogenerate command instead of the upgrade command -- there were several empty migration scripts in your alembic versions directory that looked like they probably came from that, which contributed to the conflicting heads. The revision --autogenerate is just for creating a new migration script to accompany new changes you may have made to the DB schema manually, which I don't imagine will apply in your use case. If any of this is not clear from the docs, let us know, and we'll be sure to clarify further. Thanks

Hi Alex, the migration manager (in baselayer) should actually take care of
applying migrations for you automatically, but I'd recommend stopping the
app before pulling in a new SP version and running it again, as any
in-progress DB transactions could interfere with the migration process.
There seemed to be a couple of merges in the alembic history, which
hopefully won't ever be necessary -- I'd recommend against that. Now that
the DB is already stamped, you shouldn't need to ever run the stamp command
again; just stop the app, checkout the new SP version (followed by ` git
submodule update` to pull in any pinned baselayer updates), and then when
you `make run` again, the migration manager should take care of any pending
migrations. (Alternatively, you can manually run the `... upgrade head`
command, then when that's completed successfully, start the app back up)
